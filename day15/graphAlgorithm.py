# graphs algorithm 
# edges : 1 .weighted , 2.directed 
'''
spanning tree : it is a tree , which mentain a property to no of vertices should  be n-1
no of spanning trees : (n of E)+ ... + (n-1) 
eg : if vertices are 9 and edges are 13 : 
      13 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 = = 63

* prim's algorithm : 
      select the minimum edge vetrices
      (maintian list [f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f])
      slect the minimum edge at every veritces .
